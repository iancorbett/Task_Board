# Task_Board

Description
In this project I have created a functional task board that can be used to keep track of tasks and keep track of whether or not they are still to be done, in progress, or have already been completed. For this project, I received starter code that included most of the HTML and CSS that styles the elements that you see on the page. The main thing that I had to do was create the code that renders the task cards on the page for users to see, as well as creating various functionalities that improve the user experience. I created the functionality that allows the cards to be dragged as well as the functionality that allows the cards to be dropped in any of the three columns. I also created the functionality that changes the color of the card, depending on what column it is in. Additionally, I created the pop up that prompt the users to input their title. The date, as well as the description of the task. This pop up is shown upon hitting the add task button on the homepage. When a user completes all of the fields and clicks enter, their new task card is generated and is automatically put into the to do column.

Installation instructions: This is a deployed application so you will not need to install any node packages in order to run this application. You simply need to click the link to visit the deployed repo and it will take you to the site where you can use the app. Click add task to generate popup, fill out the form and click enter, then move the card to the desired column.

Local use instructions:

If you would like to run this app locally, clone the repo into your own VS code and open the index HTML file in the live server. No additional packages are needed.

Sources: While completing this project I received starter code and that code is included in this project repo. Most of the HTML and CSS comes from that starter code. Although my project does not contain any other code taken directly from another repo, I did receive help from a few tutors, Charles, and Joem. I was able to create the functionality for the pop-up without too much difficulty was also able to render a card in the to do column without any additional assistance however, I was not able to figure out how to move one card to another column, and this is where the tutors help me. They were able to show me what I was doing wrong and why the code that I had was not working. I had tried downloading certain packages to gain the draggable functionality, but was showed by the tutors that it was not actually necessary and that there were other ways to accomplish this without the packages. Additionally, I could set the color for the note card if it were in the to do column, but much like the draggable function, I had difficulties figuring out how to make it change colors, depending on what column it was in. They were able to demonstrate this for me and show me the code necessary to make this function correctly. I was able to find a way to remove the cards from the display when they delete button is clicked, although there is stilla small bug that occurs when the app is refreshed. The deleted cards reappear, and this will have to be fixed in future development. Overall, the certain parts of this challenge that did not present much difficulty and certain parts that prove to be quite a challenge, thankfully with the assistance of tutors was able to make the function correctly.
